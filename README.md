Enhance Productivity: Automate the document review process for law firms, corporate legal departments, and small businesses.
This system is scalable, secure, and customizable to suit various legal contexts and document types.


2.Features
AI-Powered Summarization: Automatically distill complex legal texts into clear, concise summaries.
Risk Assessment Engine: Detect and flag potentially risky or non-standard contract clauses.
Multi-Language Support: Process legal documents in several languages.
Customizable Models: Fine-tune AI models to address specific legal domains and regulatory requirements.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive dashboard for document upload, review, and management.
Secure Data Handling: Ensures confidentiality and compliance with data protection standards.

3.Installation  Prerequisites
Python: Version 3.9 or higher (verify using python --version).
Git: Ensure Git is installed on your system.
Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended): Use tools like venv or conda to manage project dependencies.
Google Gemini API Key: You will need an API key from Google AI Studio to use the Gemini features.
